
Ideas:
* Deposit accounts for the money collected when building/creating/linking/using gates.
* Implement gate permissions when Permissions plugin supports adding a gate to a group.

TODO:
* Flesh out API methods
    * teleport player to gate, world/spawn, world/location
* Add API options like allow*
* Review and fix inventory handling
    * get rid of sendInventory?
    * change default settings to prevent duplication exploits?
    * delete inventory on incoming player on remote server?
* Add per-world inventory
    * global option to turn on/off
* Add "org.bukkit.material.Openable" material data type to BuildableBlock and DesignBlockDetail
* Change getExp to getTotalExperience
* Transfer PotionEffect's

Testing:
* Test minecart teleportation
* Test stairs with facing option
* Test behaviour of inter-server gates
    * Leave them open, stop and start one of the servers -> gates reopen
* Test area gates
* Test area gate corner command
